**Disclaimer:** I natively speak UK English so I know it should be 'Colour Gutter', I used to
argue for spelling it 'colour' in all variables and functions, but US English has become the
language of developers. There's no point having a bunch of variables and functions spelt 'colour'
when all the libraries we use spell it 'color', confusion would rein.
